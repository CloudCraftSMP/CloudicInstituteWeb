        <h1>Behind the scenes</h1>
        <p class="larger">A lot of work goes on behind the scenes on CloudCraft to bring you the phenomenal experience you experience (almost) every
            time you log on. Find out how your ideas go from simple suggestions to the next big idea on CloudCraft â€“ and how everything works inbetween.
        </p>

        <h2>Suggestions to production.</h2>
        <h3>A quick overview.</h3>
        <p>Every time you suggest an idea to the server, it'll be put onto a list of potential topics for the next Presidential election. The more
            similar suggestions we receive, the higher on the list it will be. Once it goes to a meeting, there's a simple flow of approvals
            which will follow:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="body">You suggest an idea.</li>
            <li class="body">The Cabinet vote on the idea during the next government meeting.</li>
            <li class="body">If receives a majority vote, the suggestion will be sent to the Department of the Executive.</li>
            <li class="body">The Department of the Executive may decide to use veto power to reject the idea.</li>
            <li class="body">If the suggestion is not rejected, it will be sent to the admin team for implementation.</li>
            <li class="body">The idea will either be implemented, or if it's a larger project, it'll be sent back to the Government to
                further vote upon.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We want you to have the best experience possible on CloudCraft, and therefore we aim for a maximum length of 1 month between your suggestion
            being voted upon at a government meeting, and the final implementation to the server.
        </p>

        <h3>Being at meetings.</h3>
        <p>Meetings with the government are usually quite chaotic, although after a while we usually come to a productive conclusion. The meetings
            usually last from 1-2 hours, and the outcome of each meeting (including all suggestions discussed) is published for the public to view.
        </p>
        <p>Unless confidential information is to be discussed, each meeting time is usually posted for the public to view, so they can come along
            and give their own opinions on the topics being discussed.
        </p>
